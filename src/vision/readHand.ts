/**
 * Turning 21 points into a gesture.
 *
 * Four things matter for playing: how many fingers are straight, where the hand
 * is, how far it leans, and how open it is.
 *
 * The first and last are measured on the model's *real-space* landmarks, in
 * metres, rather than on the flat image. That distinction is the whole reason
 * this works when you turn your hand: on the flat image a hand seen edge-on has
 * short fingers whether they are straight or curled, so anything measured there
 * falls apart the moment you rotate. In real space, a straight finger has a
 * straight knuckle from every angle.
 *
 * Position and lean stay on the flat image on purpose — those are about where
 * the hand is on the screen you are looking at.
