/**
 * Reading a pasted chord chart.
 *
 * The input is whatever the player copied: chords alone, chords over lyrics,
 * section headers, and whatever junk the website wrapped around them. Real
 * charts taught this parser three things the hard way:
 *
 *   - Lyrics can look like chords. "Do you?" contains a perfectly plausible
 *     chord token, and Leonard Cohen is not going to stop asking. So a line
 *     only counts as a chord line when it contains at least one real chord
 *     and NO ordinary words — genuine chord lines never have any.
 *   - Sites wrap chords in punctuation ("&gt;C rendered as ">C). Tokens are
 *     stripped of wrapping junk before parsing, so those chords survive.
 *   - Chord lines carry annotations — x2, (bis), N.C., bar lines — that must
 *     not disqualify them.
